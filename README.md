# YOLO-style Object Detection using MobileNet + Pascal VOC

This project implements a simplified YOLO-style object detection model using a MobileNet backbone, trained and evaluated on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset. The system is built from scratch in PyTorch and includes custom layers, loss functions, training/evaluation loops, and inference visualization.
